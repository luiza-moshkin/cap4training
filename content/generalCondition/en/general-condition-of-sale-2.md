  **Article 1 - Purpose and Scope**




  Any training order implies the unconditional acceptance by the buyer and their full adherence to these general terms and conditions of sale, which prevail over any other document of the buyer, notably over any general terms and conditions of purchase.




  **Article 2 - Contractual Documents**




  Cap4 Learning sends the client a continuing professional training agreement as provided by law. The client undertakes to promptly return to Cap4 Learning a signed copy bearing their commercial stamp. Attendance certificates can be sent to the client upon request after the training.




  **Article 3 - Prerequisites**




  Prerequisites may be indicated in the training program. The client undertakes to comply with them to the extent that it may affect the quality of the training provided.




  **Article 4 - Prices, Invoicing, and Payment**




  Our prices are exclusive of taxes. They are subject to VAT at the prevailing rate. Additional costs related to training (meal expenses, travel expenses, accommodation, courier fees, etc.) are additional. The invoice is sent to the client after the service has been performed, unless otherwise agreed upon beforehand. In the event of payment made by a Competence Operator (OPCO), it is the client's responsibility to request coverage before the start of the training from the OPCO to which they belong. The financing agreement must be communicated at the time of registration. In the event of partial coverage by the OPCO, the difference will be invoiced directly to the client. If the OPCO's coverage agreement is not received by us on the first day of training, the full training fees may potentially be invoiced to the client. In the event of non-payment by the client's OPCO, for whatever reason, the invoice becomes payable by the client. Any training commenced is considered due in its entirety.




  **Article 5 - Payment Terms**




  Invoices can be settled:




  by check made payable to Cap4 Learning


  by bank transfer:


  IBAN: FR76 3000 4008 0200 0105 0435 265


  BIC: BNPAFRPP




  Invoices are payable within 30 days, net and without discount, unless otherwise stated on the invoice. Any delay in payment from this deadline will automatically incur:




  financial charges of 1.5% per month pro rata temporis,


  the application of a penalty clause equal to 20% of the net selling price,


  immediate payment of outstanding invoices. Cap4 Learning reserves the right to suspend or cancel ongoing services, without entitling the Client to damages. All applicable duties and taxes are invoiced separately, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.


  **Article 6 - Invitations**




  Cap4 Learning cannot be held responsible for non-receipt of the invitation by the client, regardless of the recipient(s), especially in the event of the absence of the participant(s) at the training. In case of doubt, it is the client's responsibility to ensure the registration of their participants and their attendance at the training.




  **Article 7 - Cancellation, Absence, and Postponement of Registration by the Client**




  Any training commenced is fully due, even if the participant does not attend. Participant replacements are permitted at any time, free of charge, by providing written notice of the replacement's name and contact information, subject to meeting the acceptance conditions for the training. Any registration cancellation must be reported by phone and confirmed in writing. A cancellation occurring more than two weeks before the start of the training will not incur any charges. A cancellation occurring between one and two weeks before the start of the training will result in the client being billed 50% of the total cost of the training. A cancellation occurring less than one week before the start of the training will result in the client being billed the full cost of the training. A postponement occurring less than two weeks before the start of the training is considered a cancellation. However, if simultaneously with their cancellation, the participant re-registers for a training, no flat-rate compensation will be withheld, unless they cancel this new participation, regardless of the cancellation date. This penalty cannot in any case be deducted from the amount of the professional training development fee.




  **Article 8 - Cancellation of a Training by Cap4 Learning**




  Cap4 Learning reserves the right to cancel a training in case of force majeure. This includes, but is not limited to, the usual cases of force majeure or unforeseen circumstances, such as transportation strikes, illness of the instructor, or interruption of telecommunications. Cap4 Learning will then organize a new session as soon as possible, and no compensation can be requested. In the event that the client is unable to participate in the session on the proposed alternative date, Cap4 Learning will offer an equivalent training. In the case of inter-company sessions, Cap4 Learning reserves the right to cancel a training if the number of 3 participants is not reached or in case of technical or logistical problems, without any compensation. In this case, participants will be notified at least one week before the start of the training. New dates will be proposed to them. The maximum number of participants is indicated on the training programs.




  **Article 9 - Internal Regulations**




  The participant undertakes to respect the conditions of the internal regulations posted at the training venue, which they declare to have read and accepted.




  **Article 10 - Personal Data Protection**




  The client's personal data is processed in accordance with Law No. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018, relating to data processing, files, and freedoms and European Regulation 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, regarding the protection of personal data, as well as under the conditions provided by our Personal Data Privacy Policy.

  **Article 12 - Applicable Law**

  **Article 13 - Competence Allocation**




  Any disputes that cannot be resolved amicably will be under the EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COMMERCIAL COURT OF PARIS, regardless of the client's domicile or residence, notwithstanding plurality of defendants or third-party proceedings.

This clause is stipulated in the interest of Cap4 Learning, which reserves the right to waive it at its discretion.




  **Article 14 - Domicile Election**




  Domicile election is made by Cap4 Learning at its registered office at 75 rue de Richelieu 75002 Paris.
